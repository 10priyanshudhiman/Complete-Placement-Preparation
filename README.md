 Complete-Placement-Preparation
This repository consists of all the material required for cracking the coding rounds and technical interviews at tech companies as well. And this content will surely help you to crack your dream company. All the material has been taken and combined from various different sources. I will keep on updating this repository, If I feel that anything is missing. 
 
Let me know,if you wish to add anything else to this content.




#How can I best prepare for interviews?

Practice writing code in a Google doc, then running test cases on the code and optimizing it. Below are some materials that will help. Inside the information there will be a few links, a video, and also a few practice problems to help you know what to expect. Here are the top notes:

You will be given a problem or puzzle to solve and you’ll need to talk about your approach and discuss the complexity of the solutions you are proposing. You will then need to code up your solution. You‘ll want to practice coding with the first 100-150 unsorted problems on LeetCode.
 
 
Always talk through your solution, explain any trade-offs you are making between time and memory and ask any questions you need to clarify the question. It is worthwhile to talk about your initial thoughts to a question, though a brute force solution will be received less well than taking time to compose a more efficient solution.
